hpweb.theme=
hpweb.theme_comment=The HPWeb theme color to be applied to the page.  See HPWeb Layout Usage Guide for valid values.
hpweb.headerStyle=
hpweb.headerStyle_comment=By default, the HPWeb header contains four different regions: the top bar (containing the HP Passport links and the country/language indicator), the global navigation menu, the search bar (which also contains the "Contact HP" link) and the logo/title area.  As part of the enhanced design standards introduced as part of the HPWeb Hockney release, the HP.com team defined an alternate header style which removes the global navigation menu and uses a new "stretch" design treatment for the logo/title area.
hpweb.pageWidth=
hpweb.pageWidth_comment=When using the enhanced layout in conjunction with the stretch logo header, the page width property is used to indicate whether the narrow (740 pixels) or wide (974 pixels) page style should be used. The default value of this property is "wide". A value of "narrow" should be specified to force the rendering of the narrow page width. Other than the width of the rendering area, the primary difference between these two options is that the sets of links ("Live Chat", "Other ways to buy", "Order Status", etc.) which are rendered in the logo area of the wide page width are not available in the narrow page width.
