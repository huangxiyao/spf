* authentication.xml. If you are using JNDI authentication, Vignette Portal uses the 
* appropriate JNDI authentication file (for example, 
* Vignette Portal/config/examples/jndi/jndi_authentication_netscape.xml) instead of 
* authentication.xml. Refer to Vignette Portal Configuration Guide for more details 
* about configuring JNDI authentication.
