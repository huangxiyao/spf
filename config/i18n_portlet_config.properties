# Filename: i18n_portlet_config.properties
#
# Defines configuration properties for the portlet internationalization
# framework. Generally, customization by the administrator of this file
# should not be required.  But portlet developers may need to customize
# it before packaging it inside their portlet WAR.
#####################################

# Property: portlet.bundleDirectory
#
# Set this equal to the fully-qualified path on the filesystem of the
# portlet server for the portlet resource bundle directory.  This is the
# directory where message resources, image resources, etc are kept
# outside of the portlet WAR so that the administrator can manage them.
# This property has no default and it is an error if it is not defined.

portlet.bundleDirectory=/opt/sasuapps/spf/globalResources/portlet/i18n

# Property: servlet.fileRelay.url
# Property: servlet.fileRelay.isPortletResource
#
# Use these properties to define the non-default location of the file-
# relay servlet.  The file-relay servlet is the resource to which the
# portlet points the browser when it is necessary to download an
# external file from the portlet bundle directory.  (For example, when
# the portlet needs to make an <IMG> tag in the HTML which points to an
# image in the portlet bundle directory, it sets the SRC attribute of 
# that tag to a URL for the file-relay servlet.)
#
# By default, the file-relay servlet is assumed to be deployed inside
# the portlet WAR under the "/relay" path.  In other words, by default
# the following are assumed:
# 
# servlet.fileRelay.url=/relay
# servlet.fileRelay.isPortletResource=yes   # or: true
#
# If you are deploying the servlet under a different path, however,
# you can use the servlet.fileRelay.url property to override the 
# default and specify the path.  If you deploy the servlet outside
# of the WAR entirely, you can indicate this by setting the 
# servlet.fileRelay.isPortletResource to no or false.
#
# Note: These properties are used only by the code which generates
# the file-relay URL, so that the URL points to the right place.  It
# is still up to you to actually deploy the servlet there.

servlet.fileRelay.url=/relay
servlet.fileRelay.isPortletResource=yes
