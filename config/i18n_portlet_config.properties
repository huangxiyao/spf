# Filename: i18n_portlet_config.properties
#
# Defines configuration properties for the portlet internationalization
# framework. Generally, customization by the administrator of this file
# should not be required.  But portlet developers may need to customize
# it before packaging it inside their portlet WAR.
#####################################

# Portlet bundle directory (portlet.bundleDirectory)
# Set this equal to the fully-qualified path on the filesystem of the
# portlet server for the portlet resource bundle directory.  This is the
# directory where message resources, image resources, etc are kept
# outside of the portlet WAR so that the administrator can manage them.
# This property has no default and it is an error if it is not defined.

portlet.bundleDirectory=/opt/sasuapps/spf/globalResources/portlet/i18n

# File relay servlet name (servlet.fileRelay.url)
# Use this property to define a non-default location for the file-relay
# servlet.  The file-relay servlet is the resources to which the portlet
# points when it is necessary to download an external file from the
# portlet bundle directory. (For example, when the portlet needs to 
# make an <IMG> tag in the HTML which points to an image in the portlet
# bundle directory, it points to the file-relay servlet.)  The default
# location is assumed to be "/relay" relative to the portlet WAR -- so 
# if you deploy the file-relay servlet under "/relay" in your portlet
# WAR, you do not need to set this property.  Otherwise you can set this
# property, and its value will be used as the URL for the file-relay
# servlet.

#servlet.fileRelay.url=
