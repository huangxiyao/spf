# Filename: i18n_portlet_config.properties
#
# Defines configuration properties for the portlet internationalization
# framework. If the default values for the properties in this file will
# be used, then you do not need to provide this file.
#
# If you do provide this file: name it i18n_portlet_config.properties and put
# it in a config folder which is loadable by the managed server.  The folder
# may be inside the application, or outside (in a directory configured on 
# the managed server JVM classpath).  If the latter, note that all of the
# managed servers, on all physical machines in your environment, MUST
# have identical copies of this file to avoid inconsistent user
# experience.  You can change this file WITHOUT restarting the managed
# servers.

# Property: portlet.bundleDirectory
#
# Set this equal to the fully-qualified path on the filesystem of the
# portlet server for the portlet resource bundle directory.  This is the
# directory where message resources, image resources, etc are kept
# outside of the portlet WAR so that the administrator can manage them.
# By default, this directory is assumed to be "/opt/sasuapps/sp/
# global_resources/portlet/i18n".

portlet.bundleDirectory=/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n

# Property: servlet.fileRelay.url
#
# Use this property to define the non-default location of the file-
# relay servlet.  The file-relay servlet is the resource to which the
# portlet points the browser when it is necessary to download an
# external file from the portlet bundle directory.  (For example, when
# the portlet needs to make an <IMG> tag in the HTML which points to an
# image in the portlet bundle directory, it sets the SRC attribute of 
# that tag to a URL for the file-relay servlet.)
#
# By default, the file-relay servlet is assumed to be deployed inside
# the portlet WAR under the "/relay" path.  In other words, by default
# the following is assumed:
# 
# servlet.fileRelay.url=/relay
#
# If you are deploying the servlet under a different path in your portlet
# application, however, you can use the servlet.fileRelay.url property to
# override the default and specify the path.  In fact, if you have another
# location entirely for the relay servlet, you can specify that location 
# here - eg a portal URL if you are deploying the relay servlet inside your
# portal application instead.  (However remember that the relay servlet and
# portlet must both have access to the portlet bundle directory - so 
# typically they must be deployed somewhere on at least the same machine).
#
# Note: This property is used only by the code which generates
# the file-relay URL, so that the URL points to the right place.  It
# is still up to you to actually deploy the servlet there.

servlet.fileRelay.url=/relay
