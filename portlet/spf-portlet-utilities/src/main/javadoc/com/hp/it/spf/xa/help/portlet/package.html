<p>This package contains plain Java classes for online help in
Shared Portal Framework portlet applications.</p>

<a name="ClassicContextualHelpProvider">
<h3>ClassicContextualHelpProvider</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider} class
represents an instance of portlet contextual help, in its "classic"
rendition.</p>

<p>As with all kinds of contextual help, this class lets you set
some content for the contextual help hyperlink (text, an image, etc), as
well as some <b>brief</b> content for the contextual help itself (more
text and images, etc). And it provides a {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
method for generating a string of HTML ready to be output which
expresses that.</p>

<p>As "classic" contextual help in particular, this class also lets
you set some content for the contextual help title (eg some <b>very</b>
brief text), as well as numerous options for styling the look-and-feel
of the contextual help popup. The string emitted by the {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
is a long string of DHTML which produces a dragable popup table
containing the help title and content, when the link is clicked, and
which can be dismissed by clicking on an "X" image contained in the
popup.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following text message to be displayed
in your UI:</p>

<img src="doc-files/contextualHelpLink.jpg">

<p>In this message, the part generated by {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
is the link labeled <code>secure</code>. And when the link is clicked,
the DHTML in that link produces a popup table looking like this:</p>

<img src="doc-files/contextualHelp.jpg">

<p>The table is draggable and can be closed by clicking on the "X"
image. You may configure some <code>ALT</code> text for the "X" image in
your message properties, using the <code>contextualHelp.close.alt</code>
message key. For example, if you have the following message in your
resource bundles:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
contextualHelp.close.alt=Close
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Then when the user mouses-over the "X" image in the contextual
help popup, it looks like this:</p>

<img src="doc-files/contextualHelpAlt.jpg">

<p><b>Note:</b> The style of the table shown above is the default
style (which results when none of the style or width setters are
specified in the class to override it). Use the class setters (like
{@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#setWidth(int)})
to apply a different size or style.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The class assumes that your portlet application
includes the "X" image in a GIF file named <code>btn_close.gif</code>,
in the <code>images/</code> subfolder of either your external <i>portlet
resource bundle folder</i>, or your portlet WAR.  Alternatively, you can 
override this by putting a different filename, or even a relative or absolute
URL, into the <code>contextualHelp.close.url</code> message of your message
properties.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The returned HTML from this class can include
no-script markup for the unscripted case (ie JavaScript disabled in the
browser). Use the class setter {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#setNoScriptHref(java.lang.String)}
to specify a no-script HREF - this can be an entire URL, or just a
document fragment name (beginning with <code>#</code>). If your portlet
supports <code>help</code> mode, that is where the no-script markup will
point by default (and if you set a document fragment name as the
no-script HREF, that will be passed as a render parameter in that
no-script URL).</p>
