<p>This package contains plain Java classes related to property file
management, usable in both portlet applications and portal components in
the Shared Portal Framework.</p>

<a name="PropertyResourceBundleManager">
<h3>PropertyResourceBundleManager</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.properties.PropertyResourceBundleManager} class
provides hot-reloadable cached access to property files:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The property files may be localized and tagged by locale, in
	the manner of {@link java.util.ResourceBundle}, but that is optional.</li>
	<li>Property files are loaded using the system classloader, and
	thus may be located anywhere inside or outside the application (ie
	portal Web application or portlet application), so long as any
	non-standard location for class loading has been configured on the JVM
	classpath.</li>
	<li>Property files are loaded once and then cached indefinitely
	until the file on disk changes or is removed. The cache is then
	refreshed automatically at the time of the next access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the class for more information.</p>
