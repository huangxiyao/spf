<p>This package contains plain Java classes for online help in
Shared Portal Framework portlet applications.</p>

<a name="ClassicContextualHelpProvider">
<h3>ClassicContextualHelpProvider</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider} class
represents an instance of portlet contextual help, in its "classic"
rendition.</p>

<p>As with all kinds of contextual help, this class lets you set
some content for the contextual help hyperlink (text, an image, etc), as
well as some <b>brief</b> content for the contextual help itself (more
text and images, etc). And it provides a {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
method for generating a string of HTML ready to be output which
expresses that.</p>

<p>As "classic" contextual help in particular, this class also lets
you set some content for the contextual help title (eg some <b>very</b>
brief text), as well as numerous options for styling the look-and-feel
of the contextual help popup. The string emitted by the {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
is a long string of DHTML which produces a dragable popup table
containing the help title and content, when the link is clicked, and
which can be dismissed by clicking on an "X" image contained in the
popup.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following text message to be displayed
in your UI:</p>

<img src="doc-files/contextualHelpLink.jpg">

<p>In this message, the part generated by {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.help.portlet.ClassicContextualHelpProvider#getHTML(boolean)}
is the link labeled <code>secure</code>. And when the link is clicked,
the DHTML in that link produces a popup table looking like this:</p>

<img src="doc-files/contextualHelp.jpg">

<p>The table is draggable and can be closed by clicking on the "X"
image.</p>

<p>The style of the table shown above is the default style (which
results when none of the style or width setters are specified in the
class to override it).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The class assumes that your portlet application
includes the "X" image in a GIF file named <code>btn_close.gif</code>,
in the <code>images/</code> subfolder of either your external <i>portlet
resource bundle folder</i>, or your portlet WAR.</p>
