<p>This package contains WPA Portlet Edition (ie Spring Portlet MVC)
controller classes for the <code>html-viewer</code> portlet. They are
included here in the SPF portlet utilities, instead of inside the <code>html-viewer</code>
project itself, so that they are available in the SPF portlet utilities
JAR for developers to extend as needed.</p>

<a name="ViewController">
<h3>ViewController</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link com.hp.it.spf.htmlviewer.portlet.web.ViewController}
class is the controller for <code>view</code> mode. Developers can opt
to extend this class if they need to create a version of <code>html-viewer</code>
portlet with capabilities that go beyond what the SPF-provided <code>html-viewer</code>
portlet application is capable of. Then they can build their own portlet
application based on those extensions. See the class documentation for
more information.</p>

<a name="ConfigController">
<h3>ConfigController</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link com.hp.it.spf.htmlviewer.portlet.web.ConfigController}
class is the controller for <code>config</code> mode (ie the portlet
administration mode). Developers can opt to extend this class if they
need to create a version of <code>html-viewer</code> portlet with
capabilities that go beyond what the SPF-provided <code>html-viewer</code>
portlet application is capable of. Then they can build their own portlet
application based on those extensions. See the class documentation for
more information.</p>
