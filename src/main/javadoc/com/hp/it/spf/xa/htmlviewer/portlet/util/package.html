<p>This package contains utility classes for the <code>html-viewer</code> portlet. They are
included here in the SPF portlet utilities, instead of inside the <code>html-viewer</code>
project itself, so that they are available in the SPF portlet utilities
JAR for developers to extend as needed.</p>
