# Filename: propertyresourcebundlemanager.properties
#
# This file contains internal configurations for PropertyResourceBundleManager.
# The file is loaded one time only, at system startup, so changes do not take
# effect until you restart.  This file may be placed anywhere accessible to the
# context classloader.  By default we include it in the spf-common-utilities JAR.

######

# Resource bundle reload check period in seconds.  When a property file is 
# first loaded into the memory cache, it will be used from cache for this many
# seconds thereafter.  After that, the next access attempt will check the file
# on disk and refresh it into the cache if there have been any changes (or 
# remove it from cache if it has been removed from disk).  The checked cache
# will then be used again for this many seconds thereafter, at which point the
# process repeats.
