For example, <code>myViewFile.html</code>.</p><p>This file contains the content you want the portlet to display (including special substitution tokens) and it must exist.  This file should exist on each portlet server in this cluster, in the portlet resource bundle <code>html</code> folder or a sub-folder thereof.  (Alternatively, the file may exist in the <code>html</code> folder or sub-folder thereof inside the portlet WAR itself.)  If you use a sub-folder, the view filename should include that sub-folder path.  For example, <code>myFiles/myViewFile.html</code>.</p><p>The file content should be localized for the base locale.  If you have translated the content, the translated view files should accompany the base view file in the same location, and be tagged with locale accordingly.</p><p>Please refer to the administration document for more information.</p>
