# Site name prefix.
# Site names must be unique in UGS. Potentially several portal platforms (instances of SPF)
# can connect to UGS. While the portal site name must be unique within each platform, there is
# no guarantee that it is unique among all platforms. Therefore to ensure this uniqueness
# the platform-specific prefix can be used. This prefix can also be used when connecting from
# different portal platform lifecycle environments (e.g. DEV, SYS_TEST, ITG) to the same UGS
# instance - each lifecycle environment would need its own prefix value to avoid conflicts
