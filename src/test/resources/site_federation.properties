# Filename: site_federation.properties
#
# Here you configure federation information for each federated Service Portal
# site.  A federated Service Portal site is one which uses HPP identity
# federation with the customer for authentication.
#
# This property file must be named site_federation.properties and be placed in
# a config directory which is set in the managed server CLASSPATH.  All 
# managed servers, on all physical portal machines in your environment, MUST
# have identical site_federation.properties to avoid inconsistent user
# experience.
#
# As of SP R3, you can change this file WITHOUT restarting the managed servers.
#
# The format for this file currently is just:
#
#       <site_DNS_name>.federated=yes
#
# For example, to make the "acme" site behave like a federated site:
#
#       acme.federated=yes
#
# To designate a site as NOT federated, you can use "no" instead of "yes", or
# just omit the site from this file.
#
#####
#
# Following is standard demo configuration for the ACME-FED demo site:
#
acmefed.federated=yes
#
