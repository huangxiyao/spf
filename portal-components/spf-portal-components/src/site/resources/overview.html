<a name="overview"><h2>1. Overview</h2> </a>

<p>
	While the majority of Shared Portal Framework's functionality is packaged as JAR files
	and deployed along with Vignette Portal libraries, some of it complies to Vignette components
	architecture, and as such is deployed as Component Archive (CAR) files. These components plug
	seamlessly into the portal application and can leverage all the services provided by it such as,
	for example, security.
</p>
<p>
	The following sections describe SPF components. Those include secondary page types and secondary
	pages, style types and styles and portal beans. Some of them are standalone (i.e. they do not
	extend any of the built-in components), and some are specializations of out-of-the-box provided
	types. The majority of SPF components are localized through resource bundles.
</p>
<p>
	The application teams can develop site-specific secondary pages and style types for any
	of the built-in or SPF-provided secondary page types and style types. This allows to create
	and manage specialized versions of these components which override the resource bundles and JSP
	pages for the corresponding types, while inheriting the Java code from them.
</p>
<p>
	The detailed information on how to implement Vignette Portal Components is provided in
	<em>Vignette Portal Developer's Guide</em>. 
</p>

<a name="secondarypagetypesandpages"><h2>2. Secondary Page Types and Secondary Pages</h2></a>

<p>
	A secondary page defines the functionality of each Portal page. Every request is for exactly
	one secondary page which corresponds to the functionality of that request. Vignette Portal
	provides several built-in secondary pages (e.g. portlet display). It also allows the application
	teams to extend portal functionality by providing application-specific pages. A <em>Secondary page
	type</em> is an abstract component that defines a specific kind of functionality. A <em>secondary
	page</em> is a component that fully implements the functionality of its given type. There may
	exist several secondary pages for the given page type in the same portal application. Which page
	is used for its corresponding type is configured in Vignette Console. The pages and their
	corresponding types are implemented as a set of Java classes and JSP files, and are described
	with <code>component.xml</code> Vignette Component Archive descriptor file.
</p>

<a name="spf-auth-error"><h3>2.1. Authorization Error</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-auth-error-secondarypagetype</code> and <code>spf-auth-error-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page is used when authorization error occurs, i.e. the end user is trying
	to access a page or resource she is not allowed to. It does not extend any of existing Vignette
	Portal pages. Currently this page is only configured for authorization errors detected by
	SiteMinder (HP Passport or @HP). For finer-grained authorization
	errors Vignette Portal built-in page is used as Vignette does not allow to customize it.
	To use this page with SiteMinder it must be configured there as authorization error target.
	The URL of the page is <code>/portal/site/spf/template.PUBLIC_SPF_AUTH_ERROR</code>.
</p>

<a name="spf-fed-launch-error"><h3>2.2. Federation Launch Error</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-fed-launch-error-secondarypagetype</code> and <code>spf-fed-launch-error-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	Some of the sites using SPF may be HP Passport federated. For such sites the authentication is not managed
	directly by the portal or HP Passport, but is rather handled by another authentication service
	(e.g. running outside of HP, within end user's network). Once the user is authenticated there,
	the user's identity is securely propagated to HP Passport and the portal and user session is
	automatically and transparently created.
</p>
<p>
	Fedaration Launch Error page is used when HP Passport cannot assert the identity of the user
	based on the information provided by the actual authentication service. This page must be
	configured in HP Passport as federation error target. Its URL is <code>/portal/site/spf/template.PUBLIC_SPF_FED_ERROR</code>. 
</p>

<a name="spf-fed-logout-confirm"><h3>2.3. Federation Logout Confirmation</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-fed-logout-confirm-secondarypagetype</code> and <code>spf-fed-logout-confirm-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page is presented to the end user upon signing out from HP Passport federated site (for
	high level description of federation see <a href="#spf-fed-launch-error">Federation Launch Error</a>
	section). Normally it's never explicitely used. Instead the user is redirected to this page
	automatically by <a href="#spf-logout">Logout</a> secondary page when the latter is invoked for
	federated site. In addition to some explanation text the page shows a link to the site root
	URL.
</p>

<a name="spf-global-help"><h3>2.4. Global Help</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-global-help-secondarypagetype</code> and <code>spf-global-help-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page displays the global help for the portal site. If all the sites use the same help
	content, it can be defined in <code>globalHelp.html</code> file. If each site has different
	help - <code>{site}GlobalHelp.html</code> can be used where {site}
	is the site DNS name as defined in Vignette Console (e.g. for "acme-hpp" the file would be
	"acme-hppGlobalHelp.html"). The help content files are deployed as secondary support files
	for this page. They can contain HTML augmented with interpolation tokens as described in
	<a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-portal-utilities/site/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/xa/interpolate/portal/FileInterpolator.html">FileInterpolator</a>
	documentation. Finally, the help files can be localized, in which case they should be named
	<code>globalHelp_{locale}.html</code> or <code>{site}globalHelp_{locale}.html</code>.
	The URL of the global help page is <code>/portal/site/{site}/template.PUBLIC_SPF_GLOBAL_HELP</code>.
</p>

<a name="spf-locale-selector"><h3>2.5. Locale Selector</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-locale-selector-secondarypagetype</code> and <code>spf-locale-selector-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This secondary page is a target of the <a href="#spf-locale-widget">locale selector</a>
	form's action and is used to persist the user's locale selection into various locations.
	On each invocation it will update the locale used to render the portal pages in the current session.
	Moreover, it will also set standard HP.com <code>lang</code> and <code>cc</code> cookies.
	Finally, if the user is authenticated in HP Passport, the user's language will also be updated there.
</p>
<p>
	The page can take optional request parameter <code>spfLocaleSelectorTarget</code> containing
	the URL to which it should redirect the user. If this parameter is not present it will attempt
	to infer the location based on HTTP Referer header, and eventually fall back into current site's
	root URL.
</p>
<p>
	The URL of the page is <code>/portal/site/{site}/template.PUBLIC_SPF_SELECT_LOCALE</code>
	where {site} is the DNS site name.
</p>

<a name="spf-logout"><h3>2.6. Logout</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-logout-secondarypagetype</code>, <code>spf-logout-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page is used as the target for the portal logout link. The behavior of the page depends
	on how the user authenticated to get into the site. If @HP authentication was used, user is
	redirected to standard @HP logout confirmation page. If HP Passport authentication was used,
	user is redirected to the site root URL. Note that if this URL is protected by HPP SiteMinder,
	it will result in additional redirection to the login page configured in SiteMinder. Finally,
	for the federated sites, the page will redirect the user to <a href="#spf-fed-logout-confirm">Federation
	Logout Confirmation</a> page.
</p>
<p>
	This page is needed to handle SiteMinder requirement to have a single logout URL regardless
	of SPF site being used. This URL must be configured in the web agent. When invoked, SiteMinder
	will recognize it and perform signle sign-on session invalidation. The URL of the page is
	<code>/portal/site/spf/template.SPF_LOGOUT</code>.
</p>

<a name="spf-page-display"><h3>2.7. Portlet Display</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-page-display-secondarypage</code>, <code>spf-maximize-secondarypage</code>,
	<code>spf-mypages-page-display-secondarypage</code>, <code>spf-mypages-maximize-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	Portlet display pages are used by Vignette Portal to render pages for which the layout along
	with the contained portlets were configured using Vignette Console or Manage My Pages screen.
	When a portlet's window state is set to maximized (i.e. the maximized portlet takes all
	the real estate of the page content area) the <em>maximize</em> flavor of the page display is used.
</p>
<p>
	SPF defines its own secondary pages for Vignette Portal built-in portlet display secondary page
	types for several reasons. First, this allows to customize and localize portlet rendering error messages.
	Secondly, this enables the framework to propagate data, such as user profile information, from
	portal to portlets which are deployed locally into Vignette portlet container (which is different
	from the model when portlets are deployed in a remotely located WSRP producer). Finally, it enables
	the HP Web Standards compliant layout of the portlets on the pages.
</p>
<p>
	These pages must be configured in Vignette Console as default secondary pages for the corresponding
	built-in secondary page types ("Page Display", "Maximize", "My Pages - Page Display" and "My Pages - Maximize").
	The default secondary pages are configured in Vignette Server
	Console, Server Settings - Server Defaults - Site & Appearance - Default Secondary Pages.
	The site-specific configuration is done in Site Console, Site Settings - Appearance - Secondary Pages.
</p>

<a name="spf-portal-pulse"><h3>2.8. Portal Pulse</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-portal-pulse-secondarypagetype</code>, <code>spf-portal-pulse-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page performs health checks for various portal components as configured in <code>pulse.xml</code> file.
	The file must be available as a resource in class path. Currently the following checks are
	supported: HPP_WEB_SERVICE_CHECK (HP Passport login using HPP Web Services), VIGNETTE_DATABASE_CHECK
	(basic query) and WEB_PAGE_CHECK (http/https request to a configured URL and checking for the
	configured pattern in the response). A sample pulse.xml file looks as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;portal-pulse&gt;
	&lt;!-- To enable HPP Web Service check-task (no params are needed here) 
	uncomment the next line --&gt;
	&lt;!--
	&lt;monitoring-check-task name=&quot;HPP_WEB_SERVICE_CHECK&quot;/&gt;
	--&gt;
	
	&lt;!-- To enable Vignette database check-task (no params are needed here) 
	keep it uncomment, to disable Vignette database check-task, just comment 
	it --&gt;
	&lt;monitoring-check-task name=&quot;VIGNETTE_DATABASE_CHECK&quot;/&gt;
	
	&lt;!-- To enable Web page check-task for arbitrary Web page (params required)
	uncomment the next lines--&gt;
	&lt;!--
	&lt;monitoring-check-task name=&quot;WEB_PAGE_CHECK&quot;&gt;
			&lt;init-param&gt;
				&lt;param-name&gt;url&lt;/param-name&gt;
				&lt;param-value&gt;some value&lt;/param-value&gt;
			&lt;/init-param&gt;
			&lt;init-param&gt;
				&lt;param-name&gt;pattern&lt;/param-name&gt;
				&lt;param-value&gt;some value&lt;/param-value&gt;
			&lt;/init-param&gt;
	&lt;/monitoring-check-task&gt;
	--&gt;
&lt;/portal-pulse&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
	The result of the checks is printed out by the page. In addition, HTTP response header
	<code>X-Site-Available</code> is set to <code>no</code> if any of the checks fail, or
	<code>yes</code> otherwise - this allows the page to be easily integrated with load balancer
	for layer 7 health checks.
</p>
<p>
	The URL of the page is <code>/portal/site/spf/template.PUBLIC_SPF_PORTAL_PULSE</code>.
</p>

<a name="spf-return"><h3>2.9. Return</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-return-secondarypagetype</code>, <code>spf-return-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page is used as a return page to the portal, if the user needs to be redirected either to
	most recently visited page (kept in the portal session) or to most recently visited site (kept in
	a cookie). The page implements the following redirection logic.
</p>
<p>
	If the user has visited the portal in the current session, the most recently visited portal URL
	was stored in the session - hitting this page redirects the user to that URL. This capability
	is used, for example, for the integration with HP Passport Central Forms (providing user edit profile
	capability). HPP CF can only have one return URL per application, but SPF users may come from
	any of the SPF-hosted sites. Using this page as HPP CF return page ensures consistent user
	experience - user is redirected to the URL from which she left when clicking on any of HPP CF
	links visible in the portal.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the most recently URL stored in the session, SPF will also store a persistent
	cookie containing the name of the most recently visited site. If the URL is not present in
	the session, the page redirects the user to the root of the site stored in the cookie.
	This capability is used, when the user is trying to access any of the portal partner applications
	(HP applications the portal links to, which are also protected by HP Passport), when no valid
	portal session exists for this user (e.g. session expired or bookmark was used to access the application).
	In such a case the HPP SiteMinder is configured for this application to redirect the user to
	portal Return secondary page. The page will then redirect the user to most recently visited site's
	root URL. What happen next depends on the HPP SiteMinder configuration for that site.
	For non-federated site, the site root URL is either not protected and hosts the login form
	or, if protected, HPP SiteMinder is configured to redirect the user to the login page.
	For the federated site, HPP SiteMinder should be configured to redirect the user to the site's
	federation launch URL.
</p>
<p>
	The URL of this page is <code>/portal/site/spf/template.PUBLIC_SPF_RETURN</code>.
</p>

<a name="spf-site-picker"><h3>2.10. Site Picker</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifact: <code>spf-site-picker-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	The Vignette Portal built-in Site Picker page shows a list of sites the user can access along
	with the links to get to them. In general SPF does not support this functionality. This page
	can be used to overwrite the default Site Picker. Any attempt to access it results in a redirection
	to SPF <a href="#spf-system-error">System Error</a> page.
</p>
<p>
	This page must be configured in Vignette Console as default secondary page for the built-in
	"Site Picker" page type. The default secondary pages are configured in Vignette Server
	Console, Server Settings - Server Defaults - Site & Appearance - Default Secondary Pages.
	The site-specific configuration is done in Site Console, Site Settings - Appearance - Secondary Pages.
</p>

<a name="spf-system-error"><h3>2.11. System Error</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifact: <code>spf-system-error-secondarypage</code>
</p>
<p>
	This page overrides the built-in system error page. It is localized and in addition is also
	rendering error code if one was provided by SPF modules.
</p>
<p>
	This page must be configured in Vignette Console as default secondary page for the built-in
	"Error Page" page type. The default secondary pages are configured in Vignette Server
	Console, Server Settings - Server Defaults - Site & Appearance - Default Secondary Pages.
	The site-specific configuration is done in Site Console, Site Settings - Appearance - Secondary Pages.
</p>


<a name="styletypesandstyles"><h2>3. Style Types and Styles</h2></a>

<p>
	A <em>style type</em> is an abstraction that corresponds to a particular region of a web page, such as header,
	footer or the navigation. A portal page can have several style types. Each style type can have
	many styles. A <em>style</em> is an implementation of a style type having a specific appearance
	and function. Styles control the rendering of their style type's portion of the page. The location
	of each style within a page is determined by the page's <em>grid</em> defining the overall page layout.
	Which style is used for which style type is configured through Vignette Console, when specifying
	the given <em>theme</em> Associated Styles.
</p>

<a name="spf-hpweb-layout-config"><h3>3.1. HPWeb Layout Config Style</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifact: <code>spf-hpweb-layout-config-style</code>
</p>
<p>
	This is a sample style used to configure <a href="http://intranet.hp.com/Sites/SOA/TechnicalDocs/WPAPortlet/Pages/hpweb_vap.aspx">WPA
	HPWeb Layout</a> components (see "Layout Customization" section in the referenced guide).
	The SPF style implementation puts embeds into each rendered page diagnostic context information
	(wrapped in HTML comments) such as symbolic web and application server names, diagnostic ID allowing
	to filter log files for the current user session or request, etc... The actual sites using
	HPWeb components would include in their implementation of the style additional configuration
	steps.
</p>
<p>
	To use this style for a given theme, it must be associated with "HP Layout Config Style Type"
	in Vignette Console.
</p>

<a name="spf-locale-widget"><h3>3.2. Locale Widgets</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifacts: <code>spf-locale-widget-styletype</code>, <code>spf-locale-indicator-classic-style</code>,
	<code>spf-locale-selector-classic-style</code>
</p>
<p>
	SPF locale handling is configurable and complies with HP standards and supported locales.
	Locale Indicator widget can be used to show the locale used to render the current page. Locale
	selector renders a form allowing the end user to choose a locale. It is also paired with
	<a href="#spf-locale-selector">Locale Selector</a> secondary page which persits the user selection.
	The selector shows only the list of locales configured specifically for the given site
	(through <code>site_locale_support.properties</code> resource file available in the classpath)
	and masked against supported locales as configured in Vignette Console.
</p>
<p>
	Each entry of <code>site_locale_support.properties</code> has a format: "{site}={<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">RFC3066</a> languageTag 1},{RFC3066 languageTag 2}"
	or "{site}=ALL", where {site} is the name of the portal site and ALL enables all Vignette
	Portal registered locales.
</p>

<a name="portalbeans"><h2>4. Portal Beans</h2></a>

<p>
	<em>PortalBean</em> portlets are Vignette proprietary technology predating Java Portlet Specification.
	They are developped using Vignette API. Although Vignette continues to support them, new portlets
	should be built using standard specification.
</p>

<a name="spf-navportlet"><h3>4.1. Navigator Portlet</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF artifact: <code>spf-navportlet-portalbean</code>
</p>
<p>
	Navigator Portlet allows rendering, in any portal page region, a navigation node or one level of a navigation tree
	as defined in Vignette Site Console. The node to be rendered is configured in the portlet
	"Details" screen by specifying the node name (as defined in the navigation tree). Additional
	rendering properties can also be defined on that screen.
</p>
<p>
	The portlet is implemented as a PortalBean as it requires information about site navigation
	tree structure, and this is only available through Vignette API, currently not invokable
	from standard Java portlets.
</p>
<p>
	While the standard SPF build process packages all the components in <code>spf-portal-components.car</code>
	Navigator Portlet is not included there and its CAR file must be deployed separately.
