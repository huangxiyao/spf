<h2>1. Overview</h2>
</a>

<p>This is the administration guide and developer's guide for the <b>Shared
Portal Framework (SPF) HTML viewer portlet</b>. The HTML viewer portlet is a
JSR-286 portlet for displaying an arbitrary content file you provide
(called a <i>view file</i>).</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The view file may contain any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript so long
	as it is portal-consumable (eg can be aggregated with other content by
	the portal to constitute the overall page).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The view file may also contain any of the <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file.author">special
	markup tokens</a> for server-side text interpolation, as supported by the
	SPF portlet utilities' <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file">text
	interpolation</a> engine. Using these special markup tokens, your view file
	can:</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>permission content based on user authentication or
		authorization;</li>
		<li>display user profile attributes (name, email, etc);</li>
		<li>present URLs for other static resources (images, etc) or
		portal pages (but not target portlets on those pages with parameters,
		modes, etc);</li>
		<li>consolidate content that otherwise would have to be
		maintained in multiple view files</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<li>
	<p>The view file and its static resources (images, etc), if any,
	may be localized (for example, using the SPF standard localization
	business process); the portlet will render the versions which best-fit
	the user's locale.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The portal administrator, when creating an instance of the
	portlet, configures the name of the view file that is rendered by
	default. This can be overridden per request by specifying an alternate
	view file through the URL. (The view file itself, and its other static
	resources if any, are created and edited separately, not online.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The view file, its static resources, and their localized
	versions may be stored <i>internal</i> to the portlet application or <i>external</i>,
	on the filesystem of the portlet server, in the <i>portlet resource
	bundle folder</i>.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is recommended to store them externally, if you anticipate
		the administrator will need to change those files.</li>
		<li>Changes to external files take effect without restarts.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The portlet is contained in the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
	portlet application and may be deployed as a local portlet with the
	portal, or as a remote portlet accessed by the portal over WSRP. (In
	Shared Portal Framework, in practice, the portlet will be deployed
	remotely in the OpenPortal container, and consumed by Vignette Portal.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="overview.installation">
<h3>1.1. Installation</h3>
</a>
<a name="overview.installation.war">
<h4>1.1.1 Installation of the <code>htmlviewer</code> WAR</h4>
</a>
<p>The HTML viewer portlet is distributed as a complete portlet
application, in J2EE WAR format. The WAR filename is <code>htmlviewer.war</code>.
The <code>htmlviewer</code> WAR is distributed through Maven 2:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The current Maven 2 repository is <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/apps/spf-html-viewer/"><code>http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/apps/spf-html-viewer/</code></a></li>
	<li>The Maven group ID is <code>com.hp.it.spf.apps</code>
	<li>The Maven artifact ID is <code>spf-html-viewer</code>
</ul>

<p>To get the HTML viewer portlet, download the latest released
version of <code>htmlviewer.war</code> from the repository.</p>

<p>The HTML viewer is a JSR-286 portlet application, so it needs a
JSR-286-compliant portlet container. It can be local to the portal
application, or remoted with the support of a WSRP portlet container. <b>Note:</b>
For the Shared Portal Framework platform, we will generally use the
remoted approach, employing the SPF-integrated OpenPortal portlet
container (installation of this container and the application server in
which it runs is not covered here). The remainder of these instructions
will assume use of the SPF-integrated OpenPortal container.</p>

<p>The deployment procedures for the HTML viewer WAR are generally
the same as for any other JSR-286 portlet application. For the
SPF-integrated OpenPortal container, general detailed deployment
instructions are documented elsewhere in the SPF administration
documentation. For your convenience, here are the steps in summary:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Login to the OpenPortal portlet driver console.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>On the "Admin" tab of the OpenPortal console, deploy the HTML
	viewer WAR.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><b>Important:</b> make sure the WAR filename is <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
	first, if it is not already so. (This is because at least some versions
	of OpenPortal require the filename to match the context root declared
	in the deployment descriptor, which is <code>htmlviewer</code>.) After
	downloading it above, it may be a different name, so rename it to <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
	accordingly before deploying it. Also note that if you are updating an
	existing deployment, you should <b>not</b> undeploy the existing
	portlet from OpenPortal first.</p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Login to the application server (WebLogic) console.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Deploy the <code>htmlviewer.war</code> to the desired targets as
	usual for a Web application. You will find the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
	already staged for deployment by OpenPortal.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><b>Important:</b> you must deploy to WebLogic the version of the
	WAR which OpenPortal staged, since OpenPortal rewrites some of the
	deployment descriptor during the OpenPortal deployment step (above).</p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Return to the OpenPortal console.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>On the "Portlets" tab of the OpenPortal console, create your
	producer or find an existing producer to use. Then publish the HTML
	viewer portlet to that producer (you should see it listed in the
	"Unpublished Portlets" list).</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><b>Important:</b> make sure the producer is <b>enabled</b> and
	has <b>registration required</b>. The latter prepares the system to
	manage portlet preferences for each instance - a prerequisite for the
	HTML viewer portlet. If using an existing producer where registration
	was not required, you can change it - however you will have to delete
	and re-create any remote portlet server (RPS) and associated portlet
	instances in Vignette.</p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Done. You can now create and configure one or more instances of
	the HTML viewer portlet in Vignette console using the typical
	procedures for doing so.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p><b>Note:</b> on the <b>Details</b> tab for the portlet in
	Vignette console, you will be prompted for several portlet
	configuration preferences, including a default view filename and an
	optional, default includes filename. See <a href="#using">Using the
	<code>htmlviewer</code> portlet</a> below for detailed instructions. Be
	aware that, unless you have <a
		href="#overview.installation.i18n_portlet_config">installed and
	configured <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code></a> (below) to point
	to a different location, the portlet will assume the view and include
	files are under <code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n/</code>.
	Also note that, until you configure a default view file, the portlet's
	view mode will display a generic internal error message (with error
	code <code>error.internal</code>) when no alternative view file is
	provided in the URL (see <a href="#using.linking">Linking to the
	portlet instance</a> below).</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a name="overview.installation.i18n_portlet_config">
<h4>1.1.2 Installation of <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
(optional)</h4>
</a>

<p>The HTML viewer portlet uses the SPF portlet utilities to find
your view file and other local resources referenced from the view file
(such as the includes file and any images, CSS, etc which you have
locally stored). Therefore you <i>may</i> need to configure the SPF
portlet utilities' <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>, to tell
the portlet where to search for those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> You only need to concern yourself with <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
if you use <a href="#using.storing.external">external view files</a> for
these local resources <b>and</b> you are putting the <i>portlet
resource bundle folder</i> in a non-default location. (That is the external
folder on the portlet server's filesystem, where you plan to put your
externalized view content - see the discussion about <a
	href="#using.storing.external">external view files</a> below.) <i>If
you are putting the portlet resource bundle folder in the default
location (<code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n</code>)
then you can skip this.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To install this file:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Download the template for <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>.
	It is packaged with the rest of the SPF portlet configuration file
	templates, in the <code>spf-portlet-config.jar</code>. Download the
	latest version of this JAR (typically a version number is affixed to
	the JAR filename) and extract the <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
	template file from it.</p>

	<p>You can get the latest <code>spf-portlet-config.jar</code> from
	the SPF team on their Maven 2 repository, here: <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/xa/spf-portlet-config">http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/xa/spf-portlet-config/</a>
	(browse for the latest version).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Customize the <code>portlet.bundleDirectory</code> property in
	the file, so that it has your non-default path for the <i>portlet
	resource bundle folder</i>. For example, if you plan to keep your external
	view files somewhere under <code>/var/htmlviewer/content</code>, then
	you would configure:</p>

	<blockquote><pre>
portlet.bundleDirectory=/var/htmlviewer/content
	</pre></blockquote>

	<p>For more information about configuring this property, see the
	instructions both in the template file, and in the SPF portlet
	utilities guide (in the section about <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#i18n.other.i18n_portlet_config">configuring
	the <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code></a>).</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p><b>Note:</b> <code>portlet.bundleDirectory</code> is the only
	property in the file you will need to configure; ignore the rest.</p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Install the customized file, named <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>,
	where the HTML viewer portlet can access it. You can put the file
	anywhere that the system classloader searches: you can add it into the
	<code>htmlviewer.war</code> itself (eg in <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code>)
	or you can put it in any folder outside of the WAR which is named in
	the classpath for your JVM. We recommend the latter; it makes
	administrative changes to the file easier, and also means that when a
	new <code>htmlviewer.war</code> is released, you can upgrade without
	re-inserting your file into it.</p>

	<p>If you are interested in externalizing the <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
	from the portlet WAR, check how your application server is configured.
	If you are using an application server hosting environment, like DASH
	or SASU, they probably will have provided you a "global resources"
	folder on the server filesystem and in the JVM classpath. Typically
	this is <code>/opt/sasuapps/<i>&lt;your-program&gt;</i>/global_resources</code>.
	You would put the <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code> file
	there.</p>
	</li>
</ul>


<a name="overview.installation.init_relay">
<h4>1.1.3 Installation of <code>init_relay.properties</code>
(optional)</h4>
</a>

<p>The HTML viewer portlet uses the SPF portlet utilities' <i>file
relay servlet</i> to host downloads of external static resource files
(images, CSS, etc) which you are keeping in the <i>portlet resource
bundle folder</i> and which are referenced from your view file. If your view
file references such files, you <i>may</i> want to configure the SPF
portlet utilities' <code>init_relay.properties</code> to configure the
servlet to your satisfaction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> You only need to concern yourself with <code>init_relay.properties</code>
if you reference <a href="#using.storing.external">external resource
files</a> in your portlet resource bundle folder from your view file, <b>and</b>
you are dis-satisfied with the configuration in <code>init_relay_default.properties</code>
(which is delivered inside the SPF portlet utilities JAR). See the
discussion in the <a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/xa/relay/servlet/package-summary.html#init_relay.properties">package
description</a> for the relay servlet. <i>For all of the most common
static resources, the default configuration is fine and you should be
able to skip this.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To install this file:</p>

<ul>
	<li>

	(browse for the latest version).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Customize the properties in the file as needed - see the

	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Include the customized file, named <code>init_relay.properties</code>,

<a name="overview.installation.html_viewer_includes">
<h4>1.1.4 Installation of <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code>
(optional)</h4>
</a>

<p>The HTML viewer portlet uses the SPF file utilities' <a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file">text
interpolation</a> engine to parse your view files and perform dynamic
substitutions for certain special markup tokens you can use when <a
	href="#using.authoring.file">authoring the view file</a>. If you use
the <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code> token, then you will need to
configure an <i>includes</i> (aka <i>token substitutions</i>) property
file to define your key-value pair(s). By default, this property file is
named <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> You only need to concern yourself with the includes
property file if you use the special <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code>
markup token in your view file. <i>Otherwise you can skip this.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To install this file:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Download the template for the includes file from SPF team Maven
	2 repository. The template file is named <code>default_includes.properties</code>
	but you will rename it. It is delivered inside the <code>spf-portlet-config.jar</code>
	file (often a version number is affixed to the end of the JAR file
	name). You can download that JAR file from the SPF Maven repository
	here: <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/xa/spf-portlet-config">http://repo1.corp.hp.com/nexus/content/groups/public/com/hp/it/spf/xa/spf-portlet-config/</a>
	(browse for the latest version).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Add your key-value pairs to the file - see the instructions both
	in the template file, and in the SPF portlet utilities guide (in the
	section which discusses the <a
		href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file.author.token.consolidate"><code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code>
	token</a>).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Include the customized file with your <code>htmlviewer</code>
	application. By default, you can name it <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code>,
	but you can give it a custom name. (If you will have multiple portlet
	instances and you want them to use different property files, this is
	the way.) You have several choices where you can put this file:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>You can put the file anywhere that the system classloader
		searches. See the discussion on this point above, in regard to <a
			href="#overview.installation.i18n_portlet_config"><code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code></a>
		- the same comments apply to your token substitutions property file.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Alternatively, you can put the file anywhere in the HTML viewer
		portlet WAR or in the <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i>, managing
		it as an <i>internal</i> or <i>external</i> resource file like the
		view file itself - see <a href="#using.storing">installing the
		view content</a>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can have multiple such include files. When you <a
		href="#using.creating.configure">configure the portlet instance</a>,
	you will tell it the filename of the one you want the portlet to use by
	default, and its location relative to where you put it. The portlet
	will then search in the above locations for it by default. Similarly,
	when you <a href="#using.linking">link to the portlet instance</a>, you
	will have the option of overriding that default by passing the desired
	includes filename and location through the URL; the portlet will then
	search in the above locations for that.</p>

<p>All of the runtime dependencies for the HTML viewer portlet are

<h4>2.1.1. Authoring the view file</h4>
</a>

<p>Your view file must be an HTML file with UTF-8 character
encoding. In your HTML file you can use whatever text, HTML markup, CSS
and JavaScript is desired. However, remember that the content of your
file will be aggregated by the portal with other content to form the
overall Web page. Therefore for best results, your view file should <b>not</b>
include any of the following:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>The HTML <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
	tags.</li>
	<li>The HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
	tags, including any markup valid only inside those tags (such as <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
	and <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>).</li>
	<li>The HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
	tags.</li>
	<li>File editors on the Microsoft platform often insert a "byte
	order mark" (BOM) in the first 2 bytes of a file, when the file is
	saved. To avoid any possible rendering problems, remove the byte order
	mark if it is present.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your view file can contain any of the <i>special markup
tokens</i> supported by the SPF portlet utilities' <a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file">text
interpolation</a> engine. With these tokens, you can perform certain
server-side substitutions such as:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Inserting user data like name, email, and locale;</li>
	<li>Inserting URLs pointing to other portal pages at your portal
	site (though not targeting portlets with parameters, modes, window
	states, etc);</li>
	<li>Inserting URLs pointing to other static resource files (CSS
	files, JavaScript files, images, video, audio, PDF, etc) contained
	outside of your view file - either inside the <code>htmlviewer</code>
	WAR itself, or outside it in the <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i>
	(see the discussion below);</li>
	<li>Conditionally including content based on user authentication
	status or group- or role-based authorization; portlet ID or site; and
	date and time;</li>
	<li>Including content kept as key-value pairs in a separate <i>token
	substitutions</i> property file (ie includes-file);</li>
	<li>And other behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Please see the discussion of <a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file.author">special
markup tokens</a> in the SPF portlet utilities guide for a full description
of all of the dynamic server-side behaviors you can put into your HTML
view file.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Be advised that if you use the <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code>
token, you will want to create an <i>includes file</i> (aka token
substitutions file) to go with it. This is a simple property file where
you will define the key-value pairs you reference from your view file.
See the discussion about <a
	href="#overview.installation.html_viewer_includes">installing <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code></a>
above.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Also be advised that the <i>file relay servlet</i>
is already deployed inside the <code>htmlviewer</code> portlet
application. You can use any of the tokens which build URLs to external
static resources (images, etc) without having to worry about installing
that servlet somewhere. (If you want to override that servlet's default
configuration - usually this is not required - see the discussion above
about <a href="#overview.installation.init_relay">installing <code>init_relay.properties</code></a>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When your view file is finished, give it any desired filename
with either a <code>.html</code> or <code>.htm</code> file extension. If
you plan to offer multiple localizations (translations) of that content,
then create files with the same basename for each. Name the file
containing the base content (ie the content localized for the base
locale on your system) <i>without</i> any locale tag. Name the other
files <i>with</i> a locale tag as per the Java standard. Translations of
the same view file must have the same <i>basename</i> - ie disregarding
the locale tag, their filenames must be the same. Like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
my_view_file.html          # Base (eg English) view file
my_view_file_fr.html       # Generic French view file
my_view_file_fr_CA.html    # French (Canada) view file
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you will be using the SPF localization business
process, then typically you just write a base English view file, and the
localized versions with the proper tagging will be created for you via
that process. If you author your own localized versions, be sure to use
the proper locale tag in your filename.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="using.authoring.other">
<h4>2.1.2. Other resources referenced from the view file</h4>
</a>

<p>Your view file can include URLs pointing to other static
resources: images, video, audio, PDF, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.
Author these files as you normally would for each of their respective
formats. (For text files like CSS and JavaScript, you should use the
same character encoding as the view file, namely UTF-8.) The special
markup tokens <i>cannot</i> be used in these resources; they can only be
used in the main HTML file (ie the view file) itself.</p>

<p>Name your resource file whatever you prefer, giving it a file
extension appropriate for its format (eg <code>.css</code> for CSS, <code>.js</code>
for JavaScript, <code>.gif</code> for GIF images, etc). Then store your
resource files wherever you want, and reference them as usual from your
view file. Or, store them as local resources - packaging them inside the
HTML viewer WAR or outside the WAR in the <i>portlet resource bundle
folder</i>, just as you would with the view file itself (see <a
	href="#using.storing">installing the view content</a> below). To then
reference these local resources from your view file, use the appropriate
special markup token in your view file to make the URL pointing to the
resource: either <code>{CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code> or <code>{LOCALIZED-CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code>.
The <code><i>path</i></code> includes the filename as well as any
subfolder where you plan to keep the resource file (see <a
	href="#using.storing">installing the view content</a> below).</p>

<p>For example, if you have a local <code>picture.jpg</code> image
which you plan to put into the <code>images/</code> subfolder (of either
the <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i> or the HTML viewer WAR
itself), you could reference it from your view file like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;IMG SRC="{LOCALIZED-CONTENT-URL:/images/picture.jpg}" ALT="Some picture"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As with view files, resource files referenced through <code>{LOCALIZED-CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code>
should be tagged with the locale they correspond to (except for
base-locale files). For example, we would use <code>picture.jpg</code>
if the image is English; <code>picture_fr.jpg</code> if it was generic
French; <code>picture_fr_CA.jpg</code> if it was French for Canada; etc.
(As with view files, though, if you will be using the SPF localization
business process for your resource files, normally you will just create
the base English versions, and the translators will create the localized
version.)</p>

<hr>

<a name="using.localizing">
<h3>2.2. Localizing the view content</h3>
</a>

<p>Your view content - both your view file and any other local
resources like images which you reference from your view file - can be
localized. You can create the localized versions yourself if desired -
just follow the procedures for proper character encoding and naming of
the localized files as discussed in the previous section. Or, you can
use the SPF-standard localization business process, in which you just
create the English base file(s), and then send them off to be translated
by the HP Translation and Localization (T&L) team. For more information
about how this works, see the section about the <a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#i18n.l10n.spf">SPF
localization process</a> in the SPF portlet utilities guide.</p>

<hr>

<a name="using.storing">
<h3>2.3. Installing the view content</h3>
</a>

<p>Once your view content files are created - the main HTML view
file(s) themselves, plus any local resource file(s) and include-files,
as well as their localized versions - you have a choice as to where you
put them. You can either add them to the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
itself, or you can put them outside, underneath a folder on the portlet
server filesystem called the <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> This is the same principle as used in the SPF
portlet utilities for custom portlet applications' message properties
and other resource files: that is, <i>internal</i> versus <i>external</i>
resources. The same ideas apply; you may want to read the discussion on
<a
	href="http://repo1.corp.hp.com/site/portlet/2.1.2/spf-portlet-utilities/apidocs/overview-summary.html#i18n.location">where
to put your resources</a> in the SPF portlet utilities developer's guide. We
recommend you put your content files outside of the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>;
that way, when the SPF team provides an updated version of the WAR, you
can upgrade to it without first adding your custom file.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you have an <i>includes file</i>, you can install
it as an internal or external resource file, too. See the discussion
about <a href="#overview.installation.html_viewer_includes">installing
<code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code></a> above, and <a
	href="#using.creating.configure">configuring the portlet instance</a>
below. As above, we recommend your put your includes file outside of the
WAR.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Unfortunately at this time the HTML viewer portlet
does not support loading the view content or token substitution
properties to a database; only to the portlet WAR or the filesystem.
Similarly, at this time it does not provide a UI wizard or config mode
for installing that content; you have to do it without the support of
such a portlet-provided tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="using.storing.internal">
<h4>2.3.1. Packaging view content inside the <code>htmlviewer</code>
WAR</h4>
</a>

<p>You can choose to add your view content to the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>.
The advantage of this is that now wherever the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
gets copied to, the content will go along with it. The disadvantage is
that putting the content inside the WAR makes it more difficult for an
administrator to change at runtime. Note also that if you put it inside
the WAR, you will have to repeat that whenever you upgrade to a new
version of <code>htmlviewer.war</code> from the SPF development team.</p>

<p>If you choose to package your view content inside the <code>htmlviewer</code>
WAR, here is how:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Explode the <code>htmlviewer.war</code> file as you normally
	would any WAR, EAR, JAR or ZIP file. Eg on Unix you can use <code>jar
	xvf htmlviewer.war</code> for this.</li>
	<li>For organizational purposes, create a desirable folder at the
	root of the exploded WAR, to store your view file(s). For example,
	create an <code>html/</code> folder at the root of the exploded WAR.</li>
	<li>Copy your view file(s) - both the base file(s) and the
	localized version(s) if any - into the folder you just created (eg, the
	<code>html/</code> folder). You can put your file(s) into that folder
	directly, or you can organize them into subfolders of that one.
	However, be sure to keep each localized bundle - ie each base file and
	its localized variants - together in the same folder.</li>
	<li>For each type of other local resource which you have, create
	an appropriate folder at the root of the exploded WAR, and likewise
	copy those resource files into it (again, both the base and localized
	versions if any). As with the view files, you can use further levels of
	subfolder to organize the static resources, so long as you keep all the
	files of each localized bundle together. <b>Important:</b> Make sure
	the relative path and file name (ie base name, in the case of a
	localized bundle of resource files) match what you used in your <code>{CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code>
	and <code>{LOCALIZED-CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code> references in your
	view file(s).</li>
	<li>Make sure all the folder and file permissions are set to allow
	read by the application server at runtime.</li>
	<li>Re-build the <code>htmlviewer.war</code> file as you normally
	would a WAR file. Eg on Unix you can use <code>jar cvf
	htmlviewer.war *</code> for this.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, imagine that we plan to have 2 HTML viewer portlet
instances, each displaying different, localized views (including some
shared images). One of the views uses a <i>token substitutions file</i>
for the <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code> token. The layout could look
like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<code><i>&lt;web-app-root&gt;</i></code>/
     html/
          my_portlet_instance_1/
               my_view_file_1.html
               my_view_file_1_de.html
               my_view_file_1_fr.html
               my_view_file_1_pt_BR.html
               ...
          my_portlet_instance_2/
               my_view_file_2.html
               my_view_file_2_de.html
               ...
     images/
          shared/
               an_image.gif
               an_image_de.gif
               an_image_fr.gif
               an_image_pt_BR.gif
               ...
     properties/
          my_portlet_instance_1/
               my_includes.properties
          ...
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> The <code>htmlviewer</code> portlet WAR already
contains many files. Be sure not to lose or corrupt any of them when
inserting your content into the WAR or rebuilding the WAR.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="using.storing.external">
<h4>2.3.2. Installing view content outside of the <code>htmlviewer</code>
WAR</h4>
</a>

<p>Alternatively, you can put your resource files outside of the <code>htmlviewer.war</code>,
in the <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i>. This is a folder on the
portlet server's filesystem which is devoted to storing external
resource files for SPF-based portlet applications. By default, the HTML
viewer portlet assumes the folder is <code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n/</code>
but you can override that in <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
(see the discussion above about <a
	href="#overview.installation.i18n_portlet_config">installing <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code></a>).</p>

<p>The advantage to externalizing your view content is that
administrative changes are made easier than they would be if the content
was packaged inside the WAR. Also, you can upgrade to a new version of
the WAR without first re-packing your content inside it. However, you
must also become concerned with distributing your view content and
installing it into the right place in production, in addition to the WAR
itself.</p>

<p>If you choose to use external view content, here is how:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If you are using a non-default location for the portlet bundle
	folder, configure the location in <code>i18n_portlet_config.properties</code>
	and install that file as mentioned above.</li>
	<li>On each portlet server in your cluster:
	<ol>
		<li>Create the portlet resource bundle folder if it does not
		already exist.</li>
		<li>Create a desirable folder underneath it for storing your view
		file(s), such as an <code>html/</code> subfolder.</li>
		<li>Copy your view file(s) - both the base file(s) and the
		localized version(s) if any - into the folder you created (eg, the <code>html/</code>
		folder). You can put your file(s) into that folder directly, or you
		can organize them into further subfolders. However, be sure to keep
		each localized bundle - ie each base file and its localized variants -
		together in the same folder.</li>
		<li>For each type of other local resource which you have, create
		an appropriate subfolder within the portlet bundle folder, and
		likewise copy those resource files into it (again, both the base and
		localized versions if any). As with the view files, you can use
		further levels of subfolder to organize the static resources, so long
		as you keep all the files of each localized bundle together. <b>Important:</b>
		Make sure the relative path and file name (ie base name, in the case
		of a localized bundle of resource files) match what you used in your <code>{CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code>
		and <code>{LOCALIZED-CONTENT-URL:<i>path</i>}</code> references in
		your view file(s).</li>
		<li>Make sure all the folder and file permissions are set to
		allow read by the application server at runtime.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

<p>Let's repeat the previous example, this time externalizing the
content. The layout looks the same, except that it is relative to the
portlet bundle directory (eg, <code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n/</code>
by default) instead of the WAR root:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
/opt/sasuapps/sp/global_resources/portlet/i18n/
     html/
          my_portlet_instance_1/
               my_view_file_1.html
               my_view_file_1_de.html
               my_view_file_1_fr.html
               my_view_file_1_pt_BR.html
               ...
          my_portlet_instance_2/
               my_view_file_2.html
               my_view_file_2_de.html
               ...
     images/
          shared/
               an_image.gif
               an_image_de.gif
               an_image_fr.gif
               an_image_pt_BR.gif
               ...
     properties/

<h3>2.4. Creating and configuring the portlet instance</h3>
</a>

<p>Once the <code>htmlviewer</code> application has been installed
in your portlet application server, and your view content is prepared
and installed, you are ready to instantiate and configure an instance of
the portlet to display the content.</p>

<a name="using.creating.create">
<h4>2.4.1. Creating the portlet instance</h4>
</a>

<p>If your portlet deployment succeeded, and your portal is in
communication with your portlet container, then in the Vignette console
for your portal site, you will see the HTML viewer portlet listed as an
available portlet type for instantiation. Just follow the standard
procedures for creating an instance of a portlet type. You may name the
portlet whatever you like, permission however you require, dress it in
whatever portlet chrome of your choice as needed (or go chromeless), and
position the portlet wherever needed on whatever page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> If your view content uses the special <code>{PORTLET:<i>id</i>}...{/PORTLET}</code>
markup token, then when you create the portlet instance for that
content, be sure to enter a <i>portlet friendly ID</i> which matches
that token. In Vignette console, the portlet friendly ID is entered on
the <b>Basics</b> tab of the portlet instance.</p>
<p>The portlet friendly ID is also used in the logs, to
differentiate between log entries for different portlet instances (see <a
	href="#using.logs">reading the logs</a> below). So it is a good idea to
specify a good friendly ID even if your view content does not use that
token.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Similarly, if your view content uses the special <code>{PAGE:<i>id</i>}...{/PAGE}</code>
or <code>{SITE:<i>name</i>}...{/SITE}</code> markup tokens, then be sure
to position the portlet instance on page(s) and portal site(s) using the
particular <i>page friendly ID</i> or <code>site DNS name</code>. In
Vignette console, the page friendly ID is entered on the <b>Basics</b>
tab of the page, and the site DNS name is entered on the <b>Basics</b>
tab for the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="using.creating.configure">
<h4>2.4.2. Configuring the portlet instance</h4>
</a>

<p>After creating the portlet instance, go to its configuration view
(ie run the portlet's <code>config</code> mode). This is where you tell
the portlet instance what view file to render by default. In Vignette
console, the configuration view is found in the <b>Details</b> tab of
the portlet instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Until you configure the portlet instance, its <code>view</code>
mode will not know what view file to render by default, and will display
an error if invoked without any view file parameter (see <a
	href="#using.linking">linking to your portlet instance</a>, below). The
<code>config</code> mode view will remind you to specify a default view
file when you first enter the mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the configuration view, there are 4 input elements:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><b>Default view file:</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>In this text box, enter the name of the view file containing the
	content this portlet instance should render by default. In the case of
	a localized bundle of view files, enter the base name. Include the file
	extension, and any subfolders relative to the portlet bundle folder or
	portlet WAR root. Consider the example layout in the previous section:</p>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>When configuring the first portlet instance, you would enter
		just <code>/html/my_view_file_1.html</code>.</li>
		<li>When configuring the second portlet instance, you would enter
		just <code>/html/my_view_file_2.html</code>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Links to pages containing your portlet instance will be able to
	override this default view file using a parameter in the URL - read
	about <a href="#using.linking">linking to the portlet instance</a>
	below.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Default includes file</b> (ie token substitutions file):</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><b>Optional.</b> You only care about this input element if your
	view file content uses the special <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code>
	token to dynamically insert key-value pairs from the <i>includes
	file</i>; <b>and</b> that property file is named something other than the
	default (<code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code>) or exists in a
	subfolder. If so, then enter the default filename here. Include the
	file extension, and any subfolder relative to the classloader folder, <code>htmlviewer.war</code>
	root, or <i>portlet resource bundle folder</i> where the file is
	located. (The file may be located in any folder searched by the system
	classloader, such as your "global resources" folder configured on the
	JVM classpath; or it may be anywhere inside the WAR or underneath the
	portlet resource bundle folder. See the discussion about <a
		href="#overview.installation.html_viewer_includes">installing <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code></a>
	earlier in this guide.)</p>

	example, you would enter <code>/properties/my_portlet_instance_1/my_includes.properties</code>.</p>

	<p>Links to pages containing your portlet instance will be able to
	override this default includes file using a parameter in the URL - read
	about <a href="#using.linking">linking to the portlet instance</a>
	below.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Open links in new buttonless window?</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p><b>Optional.</b> The HTML viewer portlet has a secondary feature
	whereby it can rewrite hyperlinks in your view content so that, when
	clicked, the link is opened in a new, buttonless, child window. Only
	hyperlinks coded in your view file using the <code>&lt;A
	HREF="..."&gt;</code> tag are rewritten. JavaScript must be enabled in the
	browser for the rewrite to have any effect (if JavaScript is disabled,
	the link still functions but does not launch a new buttonless window).</p>
	<p>To enable this optional feature, click the checkmark in the
	configuration view. This feature is off by default.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Cache duration</b>:</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><b>Optional.</b> The HTML viewer portlet caches all of the
	resources it uses to render the view content - the view file, includes
	file, and the values of the these configuration input elements. This
	may improve the HTML viewer portlet's performance under heavy loads.</p>
	<p>The cache duration input element lets you specify the number of
	seconds until the cache will be refreshed. By default, the cache
	duration is 900 seconds (15 minutes) but if you want to enter an
	alternative value, you can enter any positive number of seconds here.
	Enter a negative number (eg <code>-1</code>) to cache forever, and
	enter zero (<code>0</code>) to disable use of the cache.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Be sure to click the <code>Save</code> button to save your
changes.</p>

<p>You are now done configuring the portlet, and you can go view or

<h3>2.5. Linking to the portlet instance</h3>
</a>

<p>By default, when a portal page containing the HTML viewer portlet
instance is requested, the content from the default view (and includes)
files will be rendered by that instance. However the URL used in the
request can include parameters to override either or both of those
resources with any alternative view (or includes) file on the system.
When you make links pointing to the page, you can set these parameters
in your link URL in order to force non-default views from the portlet.</p>

<p>The alternative view and includes filenames are specified through
parameters in the URL named <code>spfViewFile</code> and <code>spfIncludesFile</code>,
respectively. If you do not provide a parameter, then the default
resource you entered when <a href="#using.creating.configure">configuring
the portlet instance</a> will be used. But if you do provide a parameter,
that resource will be used. If the resource is not found, the HTML
viewer portlet will render an error message.</p>

<p>Parameters are provided in the query string of the portal page
URL. Parameters may be provided in the URL in either of two ways: as <i>portlet
render parameters</i>, targeted to one specific HTML viewer instance on the
page; or as <i>portal query parameters</i>, applying to all HTML viewer
instance(s) on the page. A portlet render parameter overrides a portal
page parameter, which in turn overrides the default configured value.</p>

<p>For example, the following URL causes any and all HTML viewer
portlet instances on the page to render the <code>/news/article22.html</code>
view file, while the includes file is allowed to default:</p>

<code><pre>http://my_host.hp.com/portal/site/my_site/my_page?spfViewFile=/news/article22.html</pre></code>

<h3>2.6. Reading the logs</h3>
</a>

<p>The HTML viewer portlet uses WPAP (Timber) application logging.
Configuration for these logs is in <code>logger.xml</code>, inside the <code>htmlviewer</code>
portlet WAR file. The out-of-the-box configuration generates <b>business
activity</b>, <b>performance</b>, <b>error</b> and <b>error trace</b> logs
from which you can see how the portlet has been behaving. All HTML
viewer portlet instances in the consuming portal write to these same
logs.</p>
<p>Besides the standard fields logged by Timber, the HTML viewer
portlet adds application-specific context data to the Timber logs. This
includes the SPF <i>diagnostic ID</i> (used for correlating log records
for the same session or request across multiple SPF log files at the
Web, portal, and producer layers of the architecture), the portlet
friendly ID (allowing you to distinguish between portlet instances in
the log files), and whether the data rendered came from the cache or the
source. For example, here is a business log record (the record has been
wrapped here for readability):</p>

<blockquote><pre>
09/17/2009, 19:13:04 | 12532147846432971 | 12532147846432971 | 
epi:user.standard;654e687954b2df310152dd6cb053ce01 | 
257dc89c9d78647ad00bb72db053ce01-56a6ec2482b21250e00bb72db053ce01-2636b6e39487235532e82a10b053ce01 | 
RENDER_PHASE | view | normal |  | en_US | 
{diagID:2c08c1e8+12cd20e7757+06},{portletID:hmLogin},{contentFrom:cache} |  | OK | 0.008
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This log record was for the <code>hmLogin</code> portlet instance
(friendly ID) and indicates the content (US English) was served
succesfully (OK) from cache in 8 milliseconds. The diagnostic ID is <code>2c08c1e8+12cd20e7757+06</code>,
indicating this log record was for the 6th portlet aggregated on the
page in the <code>12cd20e7757</code> request in the <code>2c08c1e8</code>
session; this information can be used to correlate multiple business log
records with one another or with log records from the OpenPortal,
Vignette, and Apache logs as well - providing a log trace through the
whole SPF architectural stack.</p>

<p>Application errors like missing or unreadable view files are
logged, as well. For example, when a portlet instance is requested to
point to a non-existent view file, it has no content it can display.
When a user views the portlet anyway, it will render a
service-unavailable error message, and the business log entry will look
like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
09/17/2009, 19:19:21 | 12532151611575614 | 12532151611575614 |

{error.nullFile:viewFilename not found or readable: forums/html/forumsHelp1.html} |  | FATAL | 0.061
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This log record was for the <code>fmHelp</code> portlet instance
(friendly ID) and indicates there was a FATAL error due to the view file
(<code>forums/html/forumsHelp1.html</code>) not being found. The error
and error trace logs will contain further information.</p>

<p>The out-of-the-box HTML viewer configuration puts these log files
into <code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/logs/htmlviewer/main</code> (where <code>htmlviewer</code>
is the context root for the application, and <code>/opt/sasuapps/sp/logs/</code>
is the WPAP Timber log root defined in the HTML viewer application's <code>web.xml</code>).</p>
