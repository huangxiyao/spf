<p>This package contains the common data model for all admission
control functions, including the <code>healthcheck</code> Web
application, and the <code>AdmissionControlFilter</code> servlet filter.
These are portal components which regulate entry into the system based
on various criteria (such as system availability), working with the
load-balancers (ie in the infrastructure) to provide load-redirection
and failover capability beyond what the load-balancers themselves can
natively provide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> SPF portal and portlet developers should never need
to use this package.</p>
