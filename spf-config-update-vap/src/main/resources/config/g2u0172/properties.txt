# Vignette Portal Configuration File
#
# properties.txt contains properties commonly changed when configuring
# Vignette Portal. After the installer runs, you can modify your
# Vignette Portal configuration by editing properties.txt. Examples of modifications
# you might want to make are configuring Vignette Portal to run behind a proxy server,
# changing the database properties, or using a user management scheme
# other than the default.
#
##########################################################################

##########JDBC DATABASE###################################################
#
# Controls the JDBC driver and database login.
#
# This section contains four properties for defining the database
# driver, URL, user name, and password that Vignette Portal uses to
# connect to your database.
#
# The default values are a simple JDBC configuration that allows Vignette Portal
# subsystems to share JDBC settings. In the default Vignette Portal configuration,
# database settings of all Vignette Portal subsystems point to "default.db", so they
# use the properties listed below.

# default.db.user and default.db.password are database-independent
# and must be configured regardless of which database you are using.
# In addition to these properties, you must uncomment the appropriate
# JDBC driver and URL properties for your specific database.
#
# Note that for all databases, except DB2, you should use the
# JDBC driver that Vignette provides. These drivers are located
# in VignetteApplicationServer/lib.
#
# DB2 drivers are not shipped with Vignette Portal. Use the driver that comes
# with the database and make these available to the CLASSPATH of
# the Vignette Portal Web application.

# A userid/username allowing login to the database.
# The Vignette Portal installer fills in the value for this property based on
# user input during the installation process. If you chose to configure
# your database manually, you must provide a value for this property.
default.db.user=VIGNETTE02

# The password for the above userid.
# The Vignette Portal installer fills in the value for this property based on
# user input during the installation process. If you chose to configure
# your database manually, you must provide a value for this property.
default.db.password=TBD


# The Java class name of the JDBC driver.
# The Vignette Portal installer fills in the value for this property based on
# the database chosen during the installation process. If you chose to
# configure your database manually, you must provide a value for
# this property.
# Sample JDBC Drivers:
#    Oracle: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
#    SQL Server(DataDirect): com.vignette.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver
#    Sybase: com.sybase.jdbc3.jdbc.SybDriver
#    DB2(DataDirect): com.vignette.jdbc.db2.DB2Driver
default.db.driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

# The URL to the database. The syntax depends on the JDBC driver.
# The Vignette Portal installer fills in the value for this property based on
# the database chosen during the installation process. If you chose to
# configure your database manually, you must provide a value for
# this property.
# Sample JDBC URLs:
#    Oracle: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<host>:1521:<SID>
#    SQL Server(DataDirect): jdbc:vignette:sqlserver://<host>:1433;databasename=<database>;DescribeParameters=describeIfString
#    Sybase: jdbc:sybase:Tds:<host>:5001/<database>
#    DB2(DataDirect): jdbc:vignette:db2://<host>:50000;databasename=<database>
default.db.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = gvu3738.austin.hp.com)(PORT = 1525))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = gvu3737.austin.hp.com)(PORT = 1525)) (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = gvu1391.austin.hp.com)(PORT = 1525))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = gvu1392.austin.hp.com)(PORT = 1525))(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVER = DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME = SRVPTLP)(FAILOVER_MODE =(BACKUP = SRVPTLP_PRECONNECT)(TYPE = SELECT) (METHOD = PRECONNECT)(RETRIES = 180)(DELAY = 5))))

# The parameters of the JDBC driver (optional). Name=Value format is used to specify
# the driver parameters, with multiple name-value pairs separated by the semicolon
# character. For example:
#    default.db.parameters=param1=value1;param2=value2
# The Oracle driver needs a property (oracle.jdbc.J2EE13Compliant=true) to be fully 
# compliant with JDBC, especially with regard to conversion of Oracle timestamp and 
# date types to their JDBC equivalents. This property is ignored by non-Oracle databases.

# Customers have full control over whether to gather metrics information or
# not. Portal ships with metrics gathering enabled by default, but customers can turn
# off metrics gathering by setting metrics.enabled property to "false".
# Setting metrics gathering to "false" stops Portal from gathering all
# metrics data from the server, whether they are Vignette-defined metrics
# or custom metrics.
metrics.enabled=false

# The ID of the database connection pool to use for the MetricsDBManager
# which maintains Metrics log Data persistence.
# If this property is empty, omitted or "default," the default connection

# Time interval at which the Metrics system will persist metrics data into
# the MetricsLog table (in minutes); used in conjunction with
# metrics.log.threshold.
#
# For example, if metrics.log.threshold=200 and metrics.log.timeinterval=10,

##########CONNECTION POOL#################################################

# Vignette Portal uses a central database connection pool to manage the use
# of database connections.  Each process needing a database connection
# requests it from the pool; the pool ensures that each process has its
# own connection.

# Optionally, you can set up separate connection pools for the following
# Vignette Portal subsystems:  Audit, Broadcaster, Cache, MetaStore, Metrics,
# and Users.
# You can also define separate database settings for these subsystems.
# If you define separate database settings for a subsystem, you must
# also define a connection pool for that subsystem.

# EXAMPLE 1 - DEFAULT DATABASE SETTINGS, SEPARATE CONNECTION POOL
# Suppose that you want the MetaStore to use the default database
# settings but its own connection pool.  The default database settings
# are defined in the JDBC Database section of this file.  To configure
# the MetaStore's connection pool, you would go to the MetaStore section
# of this file and set the metastore.default.connectionpool property to
# point to a unique connection pool--for example:
# metastore.default.connectionpool=metastore
# Then, in this Connection Pool Support section you would add four
# new properties with the same connection pool name ("metastore"), as follows:
# connectionpool.metastore.code=com.epicentric.jdbc.ConnectionPoolService
# connectionpool.metastore.db=default.db
# connectionpool.metastore.name=DefaultMetaStoreConnectionPool
# connectionpool.metastore.description=Default MetaStore Connection Pool Service

# EXAMPLE 2 - SEPARATE DATABASE SETTINGS AND CONNECTION POOL
# If you wanted the MetaStore to have its own database settings as well as
# its own connection pool, you would have the same four properties from
# EXAMPLE 1 except that the database property would point to the MetaStore
# database instead of to the default database (for example,
# connectionpool.metastore.db=metastore.db).  You would also add the JDBC
# properties for the metastore--for example:
# metastore.db.driver=com.ms.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
# metastore.db.url=jdbc:odbc:Metastore
# metastore.db.user=sysadmin
# metastore.db.password=admin

# The default connection pool id.
connectionpool.default=portalserver

# The class for the connection pool service.
connectionpool.portalserver.code=com.epicentric.jdbc.ConnectionPoolService

# A filter used to get a predefined set of properties. As shipped,
# the default connection pool uses the default database settings
# defined in the JDBC Database section of this file.
connectionpool.portalserver.db=default.db
# Use these properties if connectionpool.portalserver.db is not supplied.
# connectionpool.portalserver.driver=com.ms.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
# connectionpool.portalserver.url=jdbc:odbc:PortalServer
# connectionpool.portalserver.user=
# connectionpool.portalserver.password=

# Extra descriptors for the connection pool (used to distinguish among services
# if you set up multiple connection pool services).
connectionpool.portalserver.name=PortalServerConnectionPool
connectionpool.portalserver.description=Main PortalServer Connection Pool Service

# OPTIONAL CONNECTION POOL PROPERTIES
# The following properties have reasonable defaults for many configurations.
# However, you can set your own values for any of these properties.  If you have
# configured multiple connection pools, you can add these properties for each
# pool (for example, connectionpool.metastore.poolsize etc. for the MetaStore's
# connection pool).
#
# The comments below provide guidelines for three types of configurations:
#
# Large Pool:  A busy system on a machine where connections and memory are
# not an issue.  The large pool configuration will produce a fast but
# resource-intensive portal.  The size of the pool and the lower threshold
# keep a large number of connections available.  The lease time causes
# connections to start cycling the moment that operations are taking too
# long.  The long sleep time reduces the likelihood that the pool will
# shrink too early.
#
# Small Pool:  A mid-range system that has memory or connection restrictions
# but where performance is not critical.  The size of the pool is reasonable
# for a production system, with a small lower threshold to keep things
# ticking but not humming.  The timeout and lease time are both inflated
# to allow for more sluggish system performance.  The sleep time is small
# (using the default setting) to allow the pool to cool down when the portal
# goes quiet.
#
# Delicate Pool:  A system that is sensitive to latent connections, such as
# databases that are configured to disconnect latent connections or database
# drivers that work through firewalls.  The suggested pool size is a little
# larger than necessary, but with a low threshold and sleep time to keep the
# tick-over rate as low as possible.

# Maximum number of connections available in the pool
# Value can be any number from 1 through 2056.
# Large Pool:  100 suggested
# Small Pool:  20 suggested
# Delicate Pool:  50 suggested
connectionpool.portalserver.poolsize=100

# Minimum number of connections in the pool
# Large Pool:  50 suggested
# Small Pool:  3 suggested
# Delicate Pool:  5 suggested
connectionpool.portalserver.lowerthreshold=50

# Default connection timeout (in seconds). A process that is waiting for a
# connection will not receive a timeout exception until this amount of time
# has expired.
# Large Pool:  60 suggested
# Small Pool:  360 suggested
# Delicate Pool:  60 suggested
connectionpool.portalserver.timeout=60

# If enabled the monitor will query the DB every minute to make sure
# it's up an running. It will also test all connections when a bad one
# is returned.
# Suggested = true
connectionpool.portalserver.monitor=true

# Default connection lease time (in seconds).  If a process does not give
# back a connection during this amount of time, the connection is discarded
# and a new one is created.  This property reduces the performance impact
# caused by processes that take connections and never give them back.  If
# a process gives back a connection after its lease time has expired, the
# connection pool simply kills it.
# Large Pool:  5 suggested
# Small Pool:  60 suggested
# Delicate Pool:  45 suggested
connectionpool.portalserver.lease=5

# Connection sleep time (in minutes).  The connection pool breaks a
# connection if it is not used for this amount of time.
# Large Pool:  30 suggested
# Small Pool:  10 suggested
# Delicate Pool:  2 suggested
connectionpool.portalserver.sleep=30

# Enable/disable connection testing on return. This property determines
# whether connections should be "verified" when they are returned to the
# pool to ensure that they are still alive and functional. Settings this
# property to true provides some additional robustness to the connection
# pool at the expense of performance. Defaults to false.
connectionpool.portalserver.verifyReturns=false

# Enable/disable pooling. When this property is set to true,
# the connection pool will create a new connection every time one is
# requested. This can be helpful when trying to measure the benefit
# that a connection pool is giving to the system. This property
# should never be set to true in a production environment.
# Defaults to false.
connectionpool.portalserver.disabled=false

# Vignette Portal supports the following log levels:
#  * fatal - Indicates that there is a problem with Vignette Portal that requires
#		immediate attention. During normal operation, Vignette Portal should
#		not log any critical messages. In deployed servers, these
#		messages are typically sent to the system administrator's
#		pager.
#  * error - Indicates that there is a problem with Vignette Portal, which affects the
#            functionality of the server or its components.
#  * warning - Indicates that there is a potential problem with Vignette Portal, which
#	       does not affect the functionality of the server or its
#	       components.
#  * info - Provides information about the state of Vignette Portal. For instance,

# Note: This property is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. The Portal Logger does not implement this property.
log_max_days=2

# Maximum number of log files allowed in the log directory.
# This value applies to a given virtual machine (VM) instance.
# (Each time you restart your application server, a new VM instance
# is generated.) Vignette Portal checks this property each time a new log file is
# started and deletes the oldest logs to bring the number within the
# maximum for the current VM instance.
#
# For example, if the property is set to 12, Vignette Portal maintains 12 log files
# in the log directory until you restart your application server. On
# restart, Vignette Portal begins to create new log files, up to a maximum of 12,
# without deleting the 12 files from the previous VM instance, bringing
# the total number of files in the directory to 24. On the next restart,
# the number increases to 36, and so forth.
#
# If this property is absent or set to -1, the number of files in the
# directory is infinite.
# Note: This property is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
