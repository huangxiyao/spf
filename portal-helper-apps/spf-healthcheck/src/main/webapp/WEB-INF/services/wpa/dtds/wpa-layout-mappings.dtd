<!ELEMENT layout-mappings (layout-mapping*)>

<!-- The "layout-mapping" element establishes a mapping between a path/portal
     combination and the named layout that should be applied.

     path            The context-relative path to the page that is being decorated
                     by the layout.

     portal          The portal name that was associated with the action mapping
                     in the struts-config.xml file.

     layout          The name of the layout (as specified in the layout.xml file)
                     that should be applied to this path/portal combination.

     layoutAction    The fully-qualified Java class name of the LayoutAction that
                     should be executed before control is forwarded to that page
		     identified by the "path" attribute. [OPTIONAL]

     roles           The comma-delimited list of user roles that need to be matched
                     in order for this layout to be applied.  This is treated as an
		     OR list, so only one of the listed roles need match. [OPTIONAL]

<!-- The "layout-action" element describes a LayoutAction that is associated with a
     particular set of user roles.  For a given request, if the user belongs to one
     of the roles listed in the "roles" attribute, the LayoutAction indicated by
     the "class" attribute will be executed.  The ordering of the "layout-action"
     elements is important - only the first one that matches a given user will
     be executed.

     roles           The list of user roles (comma delimited) that must be matched in 
                     order to execute the LayoutAction specified by the "type" 
		     attribute.  This is treated as an OR list, so only one 
		     of the listed roles need match.

     class           The fully-qualified Java class name of the LayoutAction to
                     execute if the current user matches one of the roles listed in
		     the "roles" attribute.
