	DTD for the WPA HTTP Header Preprocessor Configuration File, Version 1.0

	To support validation of your configuration file and for
	admin plug-in compatibility, include the
	following DOCTYPE element at the beginning of your file
	(after the "xml" declaration):

	<!DOCTYPE http-header-mappings PUBLIC "WPA_HTTP_HEADER_DTD"
		"http://websat.cup.hp.com/dtds/wpa-http-header.dtd">
-->



<!-- 
	The "http-header-mappings" element is the root of the 
	configuration file hierarchy, and can contain any number
	of "http-header-mapping" elements.
-->
<!ELEMENT http-header-mappings (http-header-mapping*)>


<!--
	Each "http-header-mapping" element describes how, for a
	particular portal context, the HTTP header/cookie values
	should be mapped to the designated JavaBean.  The
	"http-header-mapping" element defines the JavaBean and
	where is should be stored - the nested "value" elements
	describe the mappings between individual HTTP headers/cookies
	and the corresponding bean properties.

	The following attributes are defined:

	portal		Value indicating which portal context this mapping
				applies to.  The portal context for a particular
				request is specified in the struts-config.xml file.

	className	The fully-qualified name of the JavaBean that will
				receive the HTTP header/cookie values.

	key			The name of the request/session attribute that the
				JavaBean should be stored under after it has been
				populated.

	scope		Value indicating which scope the JavaBean should
				be stored in.  Can be either "request" or "session".

<!--
	The "value" element establishes the mapping between a
	specific HTTP header/cookie and the corresponding property 
	of the bean defined in the "http-header-mapping" element.  
	Any number of "value"s can be specified for a single 
	"http-header-mapping" element.  

	The following attributes are defined:

	name		The name of the HTTP header/cookie to read.

	type		The type of HTTP value to read, this can be
				either "header" or "cookie".

	property	The name of JavaBean property that this
				HTTP header/cookie should be written to.
