<!--
	The "rule" element defines either a push or pop rule that
	should be applied to a particular portal/path combination.
	The following attributes are defined:

	action		Type of rule, should be either "push" or "pop".

	portal		The name of the portal context that this rule
				applies to.	
	
	path		The action forward path that this rule applies
				to.  When the Navigation Manager is invoked, it
				will look at the path attribute of the current
				ActionForward object and try to match it against
				this attribute.

	target		New path that the user should be directed to
				after this rule is executed.  Only applies to
				"push" rules.  Optional.

	redirect	Boolean indicating whether the Navigation Manager
				should use an HTTP redirect when interrupting
				the navigation flow.  Optional, defaults to false.
