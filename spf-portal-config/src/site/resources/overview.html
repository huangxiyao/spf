<a name="overview"><h2>1. Overview</h2> </a>
<p>
	In addition to the Vignette Console used for the general portal configuration, Vignette Portal
	as well as Shared Portal Framework modules offer additional configuration parameters managed
	through a set of configuration files. In the majority of cases these configuration files follow
	Java Properties format. Moreover, while Vignette Portal configuration updates usually require
	server restart, SPF configuration file changes are detected automatically and the files are
	reloaded without requiring the restart.
</p>
<p>
	The configuration files are divided into 2 groups. First group contains all the files which
	are global to all server instances. It is crucial that the content for these files be exactly
	the same for all the servers otherwise unexepected application behavior can be experienced.
	In the 2nd group are all the files which are specific to the given server instance.
</p>
<p>
	The SPF configuration files must be available as resources in the server classpath. Usually
	the server startup arguments' classpath refer to 2 directories. One contains the global files,
	and another one - instance-specific files.
</p>
<p>
	Additional information about SPF Configuration File Management can be found in
	<a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-common-utilities/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html#properties">Common Utilities Developer's Guide</a>.
</p>

<a name="vapconfig"><h2>2. Vignette Configuration Files</h2></a>
<p>
	Vignette has several configuration files located in <code>{VAP_INSTALL_DIR}/config</code>.
	Their content is described in
	<a href="file://g1w1545g.austin.hp.com/SharedPortalFramework/documentation/vignette_docs/portal7.4/portalconfigguide.pdf">Vignette Portal Configuration Guide</a>.
	Usually only 2 of them are updated to fit the application needs. All other updates are already
	provided as part of SPF installation package.
</p>
<p>
	<code>properties.txt</code> is where the main Vignette Portal configuration is stored. It contains,
	for example, the details about the database access - the JDBC driver class name, the database URL,
	the user and the password the portal would used to connect to the database. It has many other
	configuration properties which drive the behavior of various Vignette components.
	For the details, please refer to the configuration guide above.
</p>
<p>
	<code>log4j.properties</code> is the file containing the configuration for Vignette Portal
	logging subsystem. Vignette Portal implements logging using <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a> library.
	This file allows to configure the general logging levels but also logger-specific levels.
	It enables also to define the destinations for the log messages (e.g. files, sockets, email, ...).
	This file follow the format as defined by log4j <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PropertyConfigurator.html"><code>PropertyConfigurator</code></a> class.
</p>

<a name="globalfiles"><h2>3. Global Files</h2></a>

<a name="ac-filter"><h3>3.1. ac-filter.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	Admission Control filter is an SPF module used when portal is deployed in site-to-site (two data centers)
	active-active mode. In such a deployment the application has a global URL (e.g. app.hp.com) and
	site-specific URLs (e.g. app.site1.hp.com and app.site2.hp.com). The role of the filter
	is to ensure that before the portal user session is created the user is redirected to
	global URL so that Global Load Balancer (acting as DNS server) can properly distribute
	traffic between sites and prevent the user from accessing a site which is down or closed
	(i.e. available only for support team). Once the portal user session is created in a given site,
	the user is redirected to that site's URL - that's how the filter supports site stickiness.
</p>
<p>
	The filter is configured using <code>ac-filter.properties</code> file. It contains information
	about global and site-specific hostnames, plus additional parameters allowing to configure
	a cookie used to track the site hosting user session, access parameters for privileged access
	(support team), etc...
</p>
<p>
	The format and the content is described in the comments of
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-filters/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/ac-filter.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="default_includes"><h3>3.2. default_includes.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF provides utility classes which allow to define text containing tokens which are dynamically
	replaced when the text is rendered, based on the current request context (e.g. user information,
	locale, ...). This feature is called <em>Text Interpolation</em> and is used to define global
	help files or HTML Viewer portlet content files. The detailed information about it is available
	in <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-portlet-utilities/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html#file">Common Utilities Developer's Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<code>default_includes.properties</code> file enables to define default substitution tokens.
	For example a token defined in this file as <code>url.hp=http://www.hp.com/?lang={LANGUAGE_CODE}</code>
	can be referenced anywhere the text interpolation is used as <code>{INCLUDE:url.hp}</code>.
</p>
<p>
	The format and the content is described in the comments of
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/common/spf-common-utilities/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/default_includes.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="portalurl"><h3>3.3. portalurl.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	Java portlet specification provides a standard way to create URLs which are targeted to
	the portlet creating them. Unfortunately there is no vendor-independent way to create URLs
	which are targeted to another portal page passing in parameters for the portlets on that page.
	SPF encapsulates such URL creation in its <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-common-utilities/site/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/xa/portalurl/package-summary.html">PortalURL</a> API.
</p>
<p>
	The use of this API is also described in <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-common-utilities/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html#url">Common Utilities Developer's Guide</a>.
	The API requires some optional configuration which is defined in <code>portalurl.properties</code>
	file described in the guide as well.
</p>

<a name="propertyresourcebundlemanager"><h3>3.4. propertyresourcebundlemanager.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF configuration files are loaded using utility class called
	<a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-common-utilities/site/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/xa/properties/PropertyResourceBundleManager.html"><code>PropertyResourceBundleManager</code></a>.
	The advantage of using this class comparing to plain resource bundles is that it's able to
	detect underlying file changes and reload the file automatically. More information about
	how to use this class is available in <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-common-utilities/site/apidocs/overview-summary.html#properties.propertyResourceBundleManager">Common Utilities Developer's Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<code>propertyresourcebundlemanager.properties</code> is an optional configuration file allowing
	to specify the interval at which the manager will look for the underlying (i.e. loaded using the manager)
	file changes. 
</p>

<a name="sharedportalsso"><h3>3.5. SharedPortalSSO.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF SSO module is responsible for proper user session initialization. It includes support for
	HP Passport, Federated HP Passport and @HP authentication services. It also allows to retrieve,
	from an external data source (database, a web service), user profile information (using
	<a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-portal-session/site/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/user/profile/manager/package-summary.html"><code>IUserProfileRetriever</code></a>
	implementations) as well as a set of groups the user is a member of (groups drive access control in
	the Portal; retrieval implemented through <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-portal-session/site/apidocs/com/hp/it/spf/user/group/manager/package-summary.html"><code>IUserGroupRetriever</code></a>). 
</p>
<p>
	As several of these components are pluggable, which implementation is used for each of them
	in a given SPF deployment is specified in <code>SharedPortalSSO.properties</code> configuration
	file. The format and the content is described in the comments of
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-session/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/SharedPortalSSO.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.   
</p>

<a name="site_federation"><h3>3.6. site_federation.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	HP Passport federation is a feature allowing the integration between user's company authentication
	service and HP Passport authentication service. Putting in place such an integration requires
	configuration work on both HP Passport and user's authentication service.
	Once this integration is in place the user can sign in to the portal using her company's 
	authentication service. The federation will then ensure that the user identity flows securely
	between user's company systems and HP Passport protecting SPF portals.
</p>
<p>
	As the federated Portal sites are handled slightly differently from plain portal sites (i.e.
	sites for which users authenticate in HP Passport or @HP), it's necessary to specify which
	sites are federated. This is done in <code>site_federation.properties</code>. Its format and content
	are described in <a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-utilities/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/site_federation.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="site_locale_support"><h3>3.7. site_locale_support.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	Vignette Portal provides capability to localize sites it hosts. On top of that SPF allows
	each site to be localized in a specific set of languages (each site can have a different set).
	It also provides tools such as a secondary page and locale selector widget allowing the user to
	choose the locale from the supported set and then persists this information in the user profile,
	cookie and potenitally HP Passport.
</p>
<p>
	<code>site_locale_support.properties</code> file is used to specify which locales are supported
	by which portal site. Its format and content are described in
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-utilities/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/site_locale_support.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="ugsparameters"><h3>3.8. UGSParameters.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	<em>User Group Service</em> is part of HP Passport identity management offerings. Based on a set
	of rules defined for a given application it is able to calculate for a given user profile
	the list of groups this user is a member of. This is service may be invoked (if configured so
	in <a href="#sharedportalsso">SharedPortalSSO.properties</a>) during user session initialization.
	Upon its invocation the user in Vignette Portal is updated with the list of retireved groups,
	which are then used to manage access control to various portal resources.
</p>
<p>
	The information about the location of the web service SPF is connecting is specified in
	<code>UGSParameters.properties</code>. Its format and content are described in
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-session/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/UGSParameters.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>. 
</p>

<a name="wsparameters"><h3>3.9. wsParameters.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF integrates HP Passport web service client. It allows programmatic interaction with
	HPP authentication and user management services. This feature is used by SPF to retrieve
	HPP user groups for HPP-protected sites. It can also by used by application team implementing
	user management pages which rely on data stored in HPP database.
</p>
<p>
	The location of the web service as well as other connection parameters are specified in
	<code>wsParameters.properties</code>. Its format and content are described in
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/common/spf-common-hpp/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/wsParameters.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="instancefiles"><h2>4. Server Instance-Specific Files</h2></a>

<a name="healthcheck"><h3>4.1. healthcheck.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	SPF Portal provides a health check secondary page called <a href="http://samson.atl.hp.com:8080/hudson/job/spf-portal-components/site/overview.html#spf-portal-pulse">Portal Pulse</a>.
	In addition it also has a small web application called Open Sign which, if running, indicated that
	the portal is open to end users. With these 2 mechanisms it is possible for the portal to run
	correctly but being unavailable for end users (Open Sign stopped) due to some maintance work.
	The Pulse page and Open Sign application are invoked (through HTTP connection) by SPF Healthcheck
	application. The status resulting from this combined invocation is then relayed to the load
	balancers which decide whether to route the traffic to the given managed server or not.
</p>
<p>
	The information required by the Healthcheck application to connect to Portal Pulse page and
	Open Sign application is specified in <code>healthcheck.properties</code>.
	Its format and content are described in
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal-helper-apps/spf-healthcheck/src/main/webapp/META-INF/config/instance/healthcheck.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
</p>

<a name="spfmanagement"><h3>4.2. spfmanagement.properties</h3></a>
<p>
	While Vignette Portal <a href="#vapconfig"><code>log4j.properties</code></a> allows to specify
	loggers and their levels statically (i.e. the setting will be used everytime the server starts;
	the server need to be restarted to take into account any changes there),
	SPF provides also a way to change logging levels dynamically without requiring the server restart.
	This is done using JMX technology and tools such as JDK-bundled
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/jconsole.html">JConsole</a>.
	The console allows to query and update logging levels of different loggers present in the application
	(including Vignette and SPF modules). The changes are temporary and lost upon server restart,
	but they allow efficient troubleshooting without requiring the managed server restart.
</p>
<p>
	Currently no other than logging above and JVM monitoring management features are supported in SPF.
</p>
<p>
	The port on which the management server is running as well as other configuration information
	is specified in <code>spfmanagement.properties</code>. Its format and content are described in
	<a href="https://samson.atl.hp.com/svn/spf/source/trunk/portal/spf-portal-utilities/src/main/resources/META-INF/config/instance/spfmanagement.properties">SPF-bundled sample file</a>.
