config.viewfilename=View file:
config.viewfilename.help.title=Configuring a view file
config.viewfilename.help.content=<p>Enter the base name (including extension) of the view file.  For example, <code>myViewFile.html</code>.</p><p>This file contains the content you want the portlet to display and it must exist.  This file should exist on each portlet server in this cluster, in the portlet resource bundle folder or a sub-folder thereof.  (Alternatively, the file may exist in the root folder or sub-folder thereof inside the portlet WAR itself.)  If you use a sub-folder, the view filename should include that sub-folder path.  For example, <code>myFiles/myViewFile.html</code>.</p><p>The file content should be localized for the base locale.  If you have translated the content, the translated view files should accompany the base view file in the same location, and be tagged with locale accordingly.</p><p>Please refer to the administration document for more information.</p>
config.subsfilename=Optional <contextual_help>includes file</contextual_help>:
config.subsfilename.help.title=Configuring an includes file
config.subsfilename.help.content=<p>Unless your view file uses the <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code> token, you can leave this blank.</p><p>If your view file does use that token, then enter the name of the includes file for it here. For example, <code>myViewFileIncludes.properties</code>.</p><p>This file contains the key-value pairs you want the portlet to insert when rendering the <code>{INCLUDE:<i>key</i>}</code> tokens in your view file.  If you do not enter a filename, then a file named <code>html_viewer_includes.properties</code> is assumed.</p><p>The file should exist on each portlet server in this cluster, in a folder on the classpath (for example, your "global resources" folder), under the portlet resource bundle folder, or in the portlet WAR itself. If you use a sub-folder, the includes filename should start with that sub-folder path.</p><p>Please refer to the administration documentation for more information.</p>
config.launchbuttonless=Open links in <contextual_help>new buttonless window</contextual_help>?
config.launchbuttonless.help.title=Opening links in a new buttonless window
config.launchbuttonless.help.content=If you checkmark this option, any hyperlinks in the view file content displayed by the portlet will be opened in a new child window without buttons.  If you do not checkmark this option, they will open in the current window.  Please refer to the administration document for more information.
config.checkseconds=Number of <contextual_help>seconds to cache</contextual_help> this data:
config.checkseconds.help.title=Configuring how long to cache
config.checkseconds.help.content=<p>With this option you can specify that the above data be cached by the portlet for a certain amount of time. The cache will include the above configuration options, as well as the content of the view and includes files named above. This may improve performance of the portlet under heavy load.</p><p>To enable caching for a certain number of seconds, enter that number - for example, <code>900</code> for 15 minutes. To enable caching forever, enter <code>-1</code>. To disable caching, enter <code>0</code> or leave the option blank.</p><p>In any event, when you click <b>Save</b> on this page, the existing cache will be cleared. Therefore changes you save here will take effect immediately.</p>
