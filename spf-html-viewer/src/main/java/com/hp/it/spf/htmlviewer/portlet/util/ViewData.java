/**
 * <p>
 * <code>ViewData</code> contains the necessary resources for the HTML viewer
 * portlet's configuration and view modes. These resources include the portlet
 * preferences used by the HTML viewer portlet - the base view filename, etc -
 * and the uninterpolated content best-fit for a particular locale - the view
 * file content and token-substitutions (ie includes) file content.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The single-argument constructor loads those view resources from the portlet
 * preferences database and the filesystem, and remembers the time of load. The
 * multi-argument constructor loads those view resources from the constructor
 * parameter list (storing them to the portlet preferences database as a
 * side-effect), and likewise remembers the time of load. The {@link #expired()}
 * method returns true if the loaded view resources are no longer valid - ie,
 * have timed out. This takes into account the previous load time, and the value
 * of the check-seconds portlet preference that was loaded at that time. The
 * other methods return the respective preferences or content, or test whether
 * the load was successful.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thus <code>ViewData</code> acts as a wrapper around the portlet preferences.
 * All access to portlet preferences in the HTML viewer portlet occurs through
 * this wrapper.
