<p>This package contains exception classes and utilities for portlet
applications to use.</p>

<a name="SPFExceptionHierarchy">
<h3>SPFException, BusinessException, and SystemException</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link com.hp.it.spf.xa.exception.portlet.SPFException} class
is the root of an exception class hierachy. Portlet developers are
encouraged to subclass their exceptions from one of the members of this
hierarchy, though this is not required:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>{@link com.hp.it.spf.xa.exception.portlet.BusinessException}</dt>
	<dd>Represents a <i>business exception</i> of some kind: an error
	which was caused by the user and which the user can repair if explained
	to him.</dd>
	<dt>{@link com.hp.it.spf.xa.exception.portlet.SystemException}</dt>
	<dd>Represents a <i>system exception</i> of some kind: an error
	which was caused by some failure within the system, and which the user
	generally cannot repair.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These exceptions can be characterized by error code and error
message, and can chain together; they can also be localized with
user-suitable messages for display.</p>

<a name="ExceptionUtil">
<h3>ExceptionUtil</h3>
</a>
<p>The {@link com.hp.it.spf.xa.exception.portlet.ExceptionUtil}
class is a utility class for accessing information about exceptions
which have been set into the request (eg by the SPF {@link
com.hp.it.spf.xa.exception.portlet.handler.SimpleMappingExceptionResolver}).
