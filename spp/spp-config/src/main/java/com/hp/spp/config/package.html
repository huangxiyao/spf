<p>
	This package contains an implementation of configuration API. This API is used to retrieve config
	entries whose storage is determined by the {@link ConfigEntryDAO} implementations. The default
	implementations read and store information in the database ({@link JDBCConfigEntryDAO}) and cache
	the entries in the memory ({@link CachingConfigEntryDAO}).
</p>
<p>
	The clients of this API should mainly use the helper <tt>getValueXXX</tt> methods defined in
	{@link Config} class. This class gives also access to the singleton {@link ConfigImpl} object
	that contains other operations allowing to list, load, save and delete config entries.
</p>
<p> Note that the <tt>getValueXXX</tt> methods without default value argument throw
	exception if the entry cannot be found. If you don't want to deal with exception use the form
	of this methods that has also defaultValue parameter. </p>
